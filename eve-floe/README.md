# eve-floe — what your Eve agent's API spend really costs

**Know what every API call your [Eve](https://eve.dev) agent makes actually costs.** Eve agents
are autonomous, durable, and run unattended — Vercel's own launch cites a lead
agent that costs **$5,000/yr to run**. This template wires an Eve agent to
[Floe](https://floefinance.com) so every x402 call it pays for is metered on one
ledger — and **hard-capped server-side**, with the agent tapering as it nears the
limit instead of getting cut off.

> Floe governs the **vendor/API plane** (what your agent *pays* — 2,000+ x402
> APIs). Vercel **AI Gateway** governs the **model plane**. Together = complete
> agent spend control.

## Start building with Floe

One key for your agent's whole vendor bill — LLM, voice, telephony, search, data — metered per call and budget-capped. Let your coding agent set it up, or wire it yourself:

| Path | One line |
|---|---|
| **Agent** — Claude Code / Cursor does the setup | paste: `Read https://dev-dashboard.floelabs.xyz/agents.md and set up Floe for this project.` |
| **Skill** — install the Floe agent skill | `npx skills add floe-labs/agent-skills` |
| **MCP** — hosted MCP server (65 tools) | `npx -y add-mcp https://mcp.floelabs.xyz/mcp` |
| **NPM** — the CLI + SDK | `npm i -g floe-agent` |

New accounts get a **$3 Welcome Credit (300 API credits)** — no card. [Set up with your AI tools →](https://floe-labs.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/setup-with-ai-tools) · [Get a key →](https://dev-dashboard.floelabs.xyz)

## What's in here

A runnable Eve agent with spend control built in:

- A **lead** research agent that delegates web fetching to a **`fetcher`** subagent.
- The `fetcher` pays real **x402 APIs** through Floe and has its **own** budget cap
  (its own Floe key) — independent of the lead. Both the per-agent cap and your
  developer-wide cap are enforced on every payment.
- Each agent holds **one** secret (a Floe key) — never a provider or vendor key.

```

## Quickstart

**Prereq:** Node.js **24+** (required by `eve`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Floe-Labs/floe-cookbook.git
cd floe-cookbook/eve-floe
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in the two keys
```

Create two agent keys — each with its own budget cap — at the
[Floe dashboard](https://dev-dashboard.floelabs.xyz/?utm_source=eve&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=eve-floe),
set `FLOE_AGENT_KEY` and `FLOE_FETCHER_KEY` in `.env`, then:

```bash
npx eve dev
```

Ask it to research a topic. Watch the `fetcher` pay for sources until it nears its
cap, taper, and **stop at the budget** — the runaway can't happen.

## How the spend control works

- **Hard cap (the guarantee):** the `fetcher`'s key has a budget; over-budget x402
  payments are **refused server-side** before they settle. A refused call means the
  agent is done — not that it should retry.
- **Advisory (the upside):** the agent reads its Floe budget advisory and tapers
  (fewer/cheaper fetches) as it approaches the cap, so it finishes useful work on
  budget instead of being cut off mid-task.
- **Two tiers:** each (sub)agent's own cap **and** your developer-wide cap are both
  checked on every payment.

## Add Floe to your *own* Eve agent

You don't need this whole template — it's two steps to add Floe to any Eve agent.
See [`docs/ADD-FLOE-TO-YOUR-EVE-AGENT.md`](docs/ADD-FLOE-TO-YOUR-EVE-AGENT.md).

## Honest scope

This caps what your agent **pays vendors/APIs** (the x402/tool plane). Your
**model** spend is governed by Vercel **AI Gateway**, not Floe — the two are
complementary. We don't claim to cap model tokens.

## Floe governed-agent starters

One of three clonable templates that ship Floe spend-governance by default:

- [vercel-ai-starter](../vercel-ai-starter) — Vercel AI SDK agent, deploy to Vercel
- [crewai-starter](../crewai-starter) — CrewAI crew, Replit-ready
- [eve-floe](../eve-floe) — Vercel Eve agent with per-subagent budgets (you are here)

/**
 * Floe spend control for an Eve agent.
 *
 * Drop this file at `agent/connections/floe.ts` — or under any subagent at
 * `agent/subagents/<id>/connections/floe.ts` to give that subagent its own
 * capped budget. Set `FLOE_AGENT_KEY` in your env; that is the ONLY secret the
 * agent holds. It never touches provider/vendor keys — all spend flows through
 * Floe's proxy, which enforces your budget cap server-side.
 *
 * Get a key and set a budget cap at the dashboard:
 *   https://dev-dashboard.floelabs.xyz/?utm_source=eve&utm_medium=connection&utm_campaign=eve-floe
